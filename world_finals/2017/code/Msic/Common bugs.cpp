* READ THE STATEMENT AGAIN. TELL YOUR TEAMMATE IF NECESSARY
* Double check spell of literals
* Graph: Multiple components, Multiple edges, Loops
* Geometry: Be careful about +pi,-pi
* Initialization: Use memset/clear(). Don't expect global
variables to be zero. Care about multiple tests.
* Precision and Range: Use long long if necessary. Use
BigInteger/BigDecimal
* Derive recursive formulas that use sum instead of
multiplication to avoid overflow.
* Small cases (n=0,1,negative)
* 0-based <=> 1-based
* Division by zero. Integer division a/(double)b
* Stack overflow (DFS on 1e5)
* Infinite loop?
* array bound check. maxn or x*maxn
* Don't use .size()-1 !
* “(int)-3 < (unsigned int) 2” is false!
* Check copy-pasted codes!
* Be careful about -0.0
* Remove debug info!
* Output format: Spaces at the end of line. Blank lines. View
the output in VIM if necessary
* Add eps to double before getting floor or round
